JQuery broken down:

with bootstrap css:
	on Both pages:
		the navbar becuse a clickable collapsed menu
		all buttuns change on hover

with javascript and css opacity and translations:
	on both pages:
		ScrollMagic css uses css properties opacity and translateX to make divs appear as you scroll.

with css keyframes:
	On the about page:
		in the dark box to the right of the pointing skeleton, or above if mobile, a button wiggles to get the users attention, with a little altering this could do all kinds of transfroms
		if I had more time could have switched translations and done alot of other cool ones.

		Caveats: 

The user must be able to transition back and forth between any site pages using the site’s navigation controls.  
Suggest you start making header and Navigation bar consistent across all pages. 

There is extra credit if you integrate an XML/JSON data source with the form.  
For example, if the user selects an item they want to purchase from inventory, 
then the price form field is automatically filled in from the external data.  

 

DONE:
Due: 	Wednesday, Mar 15 
You must use JQuery in at least one of these pages. 
Ideally, you will use JQuery in the following three capacities:  
1) as JS shorthand, 2) to implement som visual effect, and 3) to perform some aspect of form processor or validation.  
Include a README file with your submission that briefly explains how you used JQuery.  The more substantial the use of JQuery, 
the better your grade. 


1
Continue to modify and expand your website.  
In particular, you will make use of JavaScript (JS) to add 
functionality to the website.  Further, for the “Informational page” 
from project #2, you will separate structure, style and content. 

		AJAX and XML

2
		Employee.xml or Employee.json

		Create a data source file (either using XML or JSON) 
that defines the content for the Informational page from project #2.  

3
		Overall Directory Subdirectory project structure with paths to connect it all
Whichever method you use, 
it should enforce the categories previously defined.  
It should also include references to the appropriate images for each item. 

4


Modify the Informational to generate HTML from the above data source.  
Implement JS routine to load the data and generate the associated HTML 
for your web page (e.g., fill in the content of a <div> element).  


5

			AboutUs.html dropdown, in middle of page (literal middle, in body, article element, between header and footer)
The updated page must include a drop down control for selecting by category what data is to be viewed.  
For example, if a user wants to see only those employees in the Sales Dept, 
they will make the appropriate choice on the control and only those individual will be rendered.  
The drop box should also have a [default] ALL choice which will display everything.  
Rely on the data source to define the appropriate categories; these categories will be the basis for displaying a particular 
element or not.  Continue to use CSS for styling. 


					FORM		JQuery/javascript

1
careate a new page
Create  a form.  
The purpose of this form is to compute the cost of some product, 
service or loan related to the business.  

2
  
You will use JS to implement this form.  
The inputs to the form need to be validated 
and the user alerted when there is an error.  
You have free license to improvise here, but the 
form must do some calculation that involves money ($).  
Some examples: 

	The form the user to input the skeleton price, down payment, 
	interest rate and term.  When the form is filled out, 
	it will calculate the corresponding payment, including 
	the cumulative interest and total cost of the purchase 
	(original price + fees + tax + interest).   

	The form the user to input the skeleton price, down payment, 
	interest rate and term.  When the form is filled out, 
	it will calculate the corresponding payment, including 
	the cumulative interest and total cost of the purchase 
	(original price + fees + tax + interest)

	If the user is purchasing a service, the form will allow them to customize the parameters of that service.  
	Ultimately, the user will be able to change the parameters to meet their target cost. 
	All calculations done by the form must be correct.  
	It should also validate input data for errors. 

	
	You will not get partial credit only if you implement a form that is too trivial 
	(e.g., calculating sales tax only) and/or produces incorrect results.

Submission:  Keep all project materials in a hierarchical directory structure.  
Create a zip file for the root directory (containing all subdirectories) and upload to D2L.
