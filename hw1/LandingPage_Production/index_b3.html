Description:   Create a single, home (landing) page for your e-commerce website.
The content of the page should communicate the type, purpose, philosophy, goals,
and themes of the business.

Characteristics:  This first page must be written in HTML5 and use Bootstrap.
At your option, the page may also incorporate CSS, JSON or XML.
It should include the following:
•	Banner
•	Navigation bar
•	Hyperlinks to other pages
•	Images (optimized for web sites)
•	Lists and tables/grids.
•	Your website should have a distinctive, yet consistent style.
I want to see evidence that you are experimenting with different elements and style attributes
•	Use of forms is not necessary or encouraged at this stage of the project.
•	Must be viewable in a 1280 x 768 pixel resolution display.
Your page must still render correctly if resized (Bootstrap will help in this regard).
.
Submission:  Place all materials in a single directory (subdirectories are allowed).
Zip up all material into a single file and upload to the D2L dropbox.

Caveats:
•	This is not a throw-away project.  Ideally, you will modify and build on this website
in subsequent individual projects—so do a good job.
•	For full credit, must render properly on the latest version Edge, Chrome, and Firefox browsers
•	Use HTML5 to define webpage structure only. Avoid using HTML elements that
are deprecated and/or implement style; instead, use CSS commands to control webpage styling.
•	This is NOT a team effort—it needs to be your own work
•	Feel free to browse other e-commerce websites for inspiration,
but do not lift another website wholesale
•	You may use rudimentary Bootstrap templates, but not those for
commercial web sites
•	Please only create a single landing page at this point
•	Bloated submissions are not appreciated.  Ditto with pages that load slowly.
Strive to keep your submission relative compact (ideally under 50MB).
In line with this goal, compress images as needed.
